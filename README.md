# Info
This plugin logs player actions to let server admins view past actions. 
It also lets plugin developers registers their own logs, which can lead
to a more detailed list of actions a player is doing, and has done.

> [!CAUTION]
> You need Java 17+ to use this plugin. If you are using a lower version consider upgrading

# TODOs
- [ ] Store logs in a database (MySQL/MariaDB, SQLite, H2)
- [ ] In-Game Log viewer
- [ ] API
- [ ] Modules (extensions which could be used to add more logs
  without the needing of a separate plugin. Similar to how PlaceholderAPI works)
